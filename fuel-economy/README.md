## Project Summary üóíÔ∏è

### üß≠- Project scenario

-   Provide data-backed analysis and recommendations around vehicle fuel economy
-   Client is interested in vehicle types, manufacturers, and technical specs
-   They want to understand how those might drive fuel economy and annual fuel costs

| **Project Objective**                                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Identify and conduct statistical tests on factors that drive fuel economy and annual costs |

### üîß- Methods

| Research Questions                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Does the Start / Stop Technology make a significant difference in fuel costs / consumption?           |
| Does the car's "age" or model year have a significant difference in fuel economy?                     |
| How significant is the car's class (car type: minivan, truck, compact...) in the consumption of fuel? |

-   Most vehicles use regular gas as a fuel type -\> focus on regular gas vehicles
    -   Regular gas is convenient, and already has nationwide infrastructure
-   Subcompact and compact vehicles are the most common classes -\> focus on these car classes
    -   These two classes are the most popular and they are quite similar in specific metrics
-   Car "age" determined by the model year -\> focus on new vs used

### **Car Age - Used Fuel Quantity**

### **5 Year Savings and Spending**

### üí°- Recommendations

-   For fuel economy and savings, without sacrificing the convenience of regular gas, use cars with Start / Stop Technology
-   Prioritize using newer cars (2015 and newer) as on average they have a significantly better combined MPG than older counterparts
-   Implementing the above and using the compact vehicle class will offer the best savings in terms of fuel economy
